					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>The modules in this tutorial will put you on the right track when you research information for your projects.</p>
					<p>This tutorial consists of five modules. It is best to view the modules in the order they appear, but you do not have to do all of them at one time.</p>
					<p>For the most interactive experience, it is best viewed on a laptop or desktop computer using Chrome, Safari or Firefox browsers, but it can be viewed on mobile devices. </p>
					<p>Each module is followed by a quiz. There will be more details on that before you begin the quiz.</p>

<p>In this module, you'll be introduced to types of information sources, both popular and scholarly.</p>

<p>You'll also learn about the information process.</p>
				</article>
				<article>

<h2>Research starts with a question</h2>
<img src="images/slide2_girl.jpg" alt="girl studying" class="feature"/>


<p>For each project, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What do I want to know?</li>
	<li>What is the information I need to find to answer my question?</li>
</ul>
				</article>
				<article>

<p>Some of your projects at Menlo might include:</p>
<ol class="reveal">
	<li class="r1"><img class="info-icon" src="images/m1r1.gif" alt="market research graphic"/><strong>Doing market research on a product or company</strong></li>
	<li class="r2"><img class="info-icon" src="images/m1r2.gif" alt="psychology assignment graphic"/><strong>Finding scholarly articles for a psychology assignment</strong></li>
	<li class="r3"><img class="info-icon" src="images/m1r3.gif" alt="ancient civilization paper graphic"/><strong>Writing a paper about an ancient civilization</strong></li>
	<li class="r4"><img class="info-icon" src="images/m1r4.gif" alt="issue debate graphic"/><strong>Researching a controversial issue for a debate</strong></li>
	<li class="r5"><img class="info-icon" src="images/m1r5.gif" alt="business plan graphic"/><strong>Creating a business plan</strong></li>
</ol>
				</article>

<h2>Types of information sources</h2>

<img src="images/slide7_apples_oranges.JPG" alt="apple and orange" class="feature"/>


<p>In order to determine which sources are the most authoritative and will best meet your needs for a particular  project, you have to understand something about the types of information sources that exist.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
	<img src="images/mod1slide7gumballs.png" alt="data, periodicals, books" class="feature"/>
<ul>
	<li>Some sources you'll use to answer research questions might be:
	<ul>
		<li>data and statistics</li>
		<li>magazine, newspaper, and journal articles</li>
		<li>books</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
				</article>
				<article>
<ul>
	<li>You'll use information sources in print and online formats.</li>
	<li>You'll use both popular and scholarly sources, depending on the project
	
	<ul>
		<li>Popular sources are written for a general audience. Scholarly sources are written for an academic audience. You'll hear about these sources in more detail later.</li>
		<li>Each type of information source is the product of a process involving varying amounts of research, writing, and  review.</li>
		<li>Let's take a closer look, beginning with data and statistics.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/mod1slide8gumballs.png" alt="party and scholar" class="feature"/>

				<article>

<h3>Data and statistics</h3>
	<img src="images/mod1slide9gumballs.png" alt="DNA and chart" class="feature"/>
<ul>
	<li>Data interpretation and analysis lead to the creation of information and knowledge.</li>
	<li>Data collection can take minutes (such as weather data) or years (such as census data)</li>
	<li>Data are multidisciplinary; the same set of data can be used by researchers in many different fields.</li>
	<li>Data can be in either numeric or non-numeric form. For example, statistics about traffic patterns are numeric data,  while videos of runners at the finish line of a race are non-numeric data.</li>
	<li>Knowing how to find and make use of data will be a valuable skill long after you graduate.</li>
</ul>
				</article>
				<article>
				<div class="article-image">
					<img src="images/slide12_popular_sources.jpg" alt="popular magazines"/>
				</div>
<h3>Popular sources</h3>
<p>Here, the word "popular" is used to describe something that is intended for use by the general public.</p>
<p>Popular information sources:</p>
<ul>
	<li>May be online, in print, or both.</li>
	<li>Include some books, as well as magazines, newspapers, blogs, web sites, product catalogs and reviews, and company  annual reports.</li>
	<li>Are published on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis and can take anywhere from a day (newspapers) to months (in- depth magazine articles) to produce.</li>
	<li>Are written by paid journalists or authors who may not have scholarly expertise.</li>
	<li>May report on the original research of others, information from scholarly sources, current events, and include data  or facts about events.</li>
	<li>Often do not include bibliographies or lists of sources.</li>
	<li>May be reviewed by editors or may be self-published.</li>
	<li>Are selected by librarians for the Library's collection based on subjects that students and faculty research here  at Menlo.</li>
</ul>

				</div>

<h3>Scholarly/academic sources</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scholarly sources are also often called academic, peer-reviewed, or refereed sources.</li>
<li>Scholarly sources can take months or years to produce and publish because of the research and review process that  goes into creating them.</li>
<li>Let's take a look at this research and review process.</li>
</ul>
				</article>
				<article>
<h3>The scholarly research and review process</h3>
<ol  class="reveal">
	<li class="r1"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>Researchers conduct research or experiments, then write about their findings.</strong></li>
	<li class="r2"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>Researchers submit the article to a peer-reviewed journal or, if it's a book, to an academic press or publisher.</strong></li>
	<li class="r3"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>The article or book is reviewed by other experts (the researchers' peers) in the same field as the researcher.</strong></li>
	<li class="r4"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>Peer-reviewers may suggest or require changes, or they may reject the work entirely.</strong></li>
	<li class="r5"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>Researchers make changes based on the reviewers' comments.</strong></li>
	<li class="r1"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>The article or book is published by the journal or publisher in print and digital formats.</strong></li>
	<li class="r2"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>Librarians review, select, and subscribe to books, print journals, and online databases containing these scholarly  works to support courses and research at Menlo. Access is provided on the Library's web site.</strong></li>
	<li class="r3"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>Researchers identify a question or topic in need of further research.</strong></li>
</ol>
				</article>
				<article>

<h4>Textbooks and reference works:</h4>
				<div class="article-image">
					<img src="images/slide16ref_books.jpg" alt="books on shelves"/>
				</div>
<ul>
	<li>Compile and synthesize the most important information about a subject from other scholarly sources</li>
	<li>Provide an overview of essential knowledge on a subject</li>
	<li>May be general (World Encyclopedia) or subject specific (Dictionary of Psychology)</li>
</ul>
				</article>
				<article>

<h5>Reference works :</h5>
<img src="images/mod1slide17gumballs.png" alt="databases and books" class="feature"/>
<ul>
	<li>Are an excellent place to begin your search</li>
	<li>Are not intended to be read cover to cover</li>
	<li>Provide background, main concepts, and organization of a topic</li>
	<li>Provide the important vocabulary and terms you'll use when you begin to search for more information</li>
	<li>Can be in print or online</li>
</ul>
				</article>
				<article>

<h4>Scholarly information sources: Is Wikipedia one?</h4>
<div class="article-image">
	<img src="images/wikipedia.png" alt="Wikipedia"/>
</div>

<ul>
	<li>You're familiar with Wikipedia, but it is not an academic source.</li>
	<li>Entries in Wikipedia are created by many contributors, many of whom are not experts.</li>
	<li>Information in Wikipedia is sometimes inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
	<li>But before disregarding Wikipedia, consider how it can be useful:
		<ul>
			<li>Offers an overview of an unfamiliar topic</li>
			<li>Provides useful keywords or search terms</li>
			<li>Might include a bibliography with sources that you can use to find more information</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overview of the information process</h3>
<p>Although the various types of information sources are different in several ways, they also have something in common:  
the use of data. Data are the building blocks of information and include much more than numbers. Data are facts,  events, and items of information presented in visible form.</p>
<img src="images/flower_animated.gif" alt="data flower" class="feature"/>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Popular sources:</strong>
Researchers and writers of popular sources such as news articles, blogs, and books often include data, facts, and  details of events in their work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scholarly sources:</strong>
Just as data form the basis for popular information sources, data play an even larger role in scholarly work.  Scholarly information sources include things like journal articles, 
scholarly books, data sets, dissertations,  textbooks, and reference works.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scholarly &amp; popular sources:</strong>
We've talked about the research process from data to published work.
But where do YOU fit in?
</li>
</ul>
				</article>
				<article>

<h4>Where YOU fit into the process:</h4>
<img src="images/slide24_data_plus_you.png" alt="data with student" class="feature"/>
<ul>
	<li>Understanding the differences between information types will help you decide which sources to use for your  projects.</li>
	<li>This knowledge will also help you decide where to search.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recap of what you've learned</h3>
<p>Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Recognize the central role of data in the information process</li>
	<li>Identify characteristics of popular and scholarly information sources</li>
	<li>Understand the scholarly research and review process</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <a href="#module2">next module</a>, we'll discuss the process of searching for information.</p>

					<ul role="presentation">
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q1q2" data-c="true"/> A. Magazine article
							<span class="error hide">Yes, articles in magazines are written for the general public and are considered popular. However, there is one more popular information source you must identify to get full credit for this question.</span>
						</li>
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q1q2" data-c="false"/> B. Reference book

				<h2>Getting ready to search</h2>
				<p>In Module 1 you learned about types of information sources; now it’s time to start using some of them.</p>
				<p>
In this module, you’ll learn how to search library resources effectively.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Designing your search</h2>
				<h3>How to begin a successful search</h3>
				<ol class="reveal">
					<li class="r1"><img src="images/m2r1.gif"  class="info-icon" alt="students reading"/>
					<strong>Carefully read your assignment and be sure you understand it</strong></li>
					<li class="r2"><img src="images/m2r2.gif" class="info-icon" alt="highligting terms"/>
					<strong>Identify the key words or concepts</strong></li>

					<strong>Find synonyms for the main terms</strong></li>
					<li class="r4"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="arrow icon"/>
					<strong>Document your search by keeping a list of all search terms</strong></li>
				</ol>
				
			</article>
			<article>
			<h2>It’s your turn to design a search</h2>
			<p>In a class or in the work world, you may have a project like the one listed below. Review it carefully and discuss it with your professor or your boss and your client, if appropriate, to ensure you have a successful project.</p>
<p>
<strong>Project:</strong> You work in the marketing field. You have a client who is investigating launching a new green product and is interested in the characteristics of consumers who use such products. Choose search terms to suit each category. You must pick 3 valid search terms for each one. Remember that there may be other good search terms that we haven’t listed here.</p>
				<form id="search1" name="search1" class="exercise">
				<h3>Green Products</h3>
					<label for="2q1">Green products term 1:</label>

			<h2>Brainstorm a concept map</h2>
			<img src="images/slide4_concept map.jpg" alt="concept map whiteboard" class="feature"/>
			<ul>
				<li>Sometimes a visual or concept map can also help you brainstorm search terms.</li>
				<li>Additionally, it might help you develop an outline for your project.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here’s a sample concept map for the following psychology project:</p>
			<h3>
			Examine the psychological causes and effects of bullying among adolescents.
			</h3>
			<p>Once you’ve considered the search terms you’ll use, you’re ready to try them out in a search. But where will you start?</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Web Searching</h2>
				<h3>Your first stop might be Google, and you might have some success there, but remember…</h3>
				<img src="images/slide6_web_search2.png" alt="Web search funnel" class="feature"/>
				
				<h3>You’ll get millions of results to sort through, many of which will not be helpful.</h3>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Going beyond Google</h2>
				
				<p>Google sometimes <em>is</em> the fastest, easiest way to the information you need –think about movie listings or sports scores –but it might not meet your needs for academic projects.</p>
				<img src="images/mod2slide7gumballs.png" alt="easy doesn't equal scholarly" class="feature"/>
				<ul>
					<li>There <em>are</em> ways you can use Google successfully in your academic work, such as Google Scholar, and we’ll discuss that in the next module.</li>
					<li>But if not Google, where <em>should</em> you start your search?</li>
				</ul>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>Using library resources</h3>
				<p>The place to start your search is the Library’s web site. You’ll find thousands of online and print resources that have been selected by the Menlo librarians to support your classes and assignments.</p>
				<img src="images/mod2slide8gumballs.png" alt="library web resources" class="feature"/>
<p>You won’t find most of our resources on Google or the Web because our subscriptions are available only to the Menlo community.</p>
			<p>When you need books and e-books, you can find them in our catalog; when you need articles, you can find them in our databases.</p>
			<p>And when you need to know if the Library subscribes to a particular magazine, journal, or newspaper, you can use the Journal Finder to search by title. It will tell you if the publication is available on our shelves or in our databases.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>So, what <em>is</em> a database?</h3>
				<img src="images/mod2slide10gumballs.png" alt="databases for information" class="feature"/>
				<ul>
					<li>You’ll hear the word “database” a lot when using library resources, so let’s be sure you know what they are.</li>
					<li>Databases are searchable collections of information. You already use them when you search for songs in iTunes, for friends in Facebook, and for books in Amazon.</li>
					<li>Most databases rely on similar methods of searching, so while the databases themselves may look different, once you have mastered one, it’s much easier to learn how to search others.</li>
				</ul>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>Library catalog</h3>
				<img src="images/slide9_Library_materials.jpg" alt="library materials search" class="feature"/>
				<p><strong>The Library catalog is one
database you’ll be using.</strong> It’s
the place to find print books,
e-books, dvds, cds, print
magazines, and print journals.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You won’t find individual articles here, however. You’ll have to search one of the Library’s subscription databases for those.</li>
				<li>Let’s take a look at how to search the Bowman Library catalog.</li>
			</ul>
			</article>

					<h2>Continuing to search</h2>
					<p>In the previous module on searching, we discussed using the library catalog when you need books.</p>
<p>In this module, we’ll talk about the times when you’ll need articles from periodicals (magazines, journals, newspapers). That’s when you’ll want to turn to the Library’s databases.</p>

					<h2>Library databases (when)</h2>
					<img src="images/slide4_Menlo_ID.jpg" alt="Menlo College ID barcode" class="feature"/>
					<p>If you’re not sure where to begin your search, you can always ask a librarian, in person or by phone. We’re here every hour that the Library is open and we’re here to help! You can access the library databases 24/7 with your library barcode.</p>

					<h3>It's your turn to choose databases</h3>
					<img src="images/slide5_woman_and_doors.jpg" alt="woman choosing from doors" class="feature"/>
					<p>Individual library databases might focus on only one subject, such as psychology or business, or might contain articles from many disciplines. Using the description of the databases listed below, match each with the kind of information you might expect to find there.</p>

					<h2>Advanced search techniques</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Scholarly databases like the ones the Library subscribes to are more complicated to use than search engines like Google and Yahoo because they offer sophisticated tools and techniques for searching that can improve your results.</li>
						<li>Many databases, including the library catalog, offer tools to help you narrow or expand your search. Take advantage of these.</li>
						<li>The most common tools are:
						<ul>
							<li>Boolean searching</li>
							<li>Truncation</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						
					</ul>

					<h3>Boolean searching</h3>
					<p>Boolean searching uses AND, OR, and NOT when combining your search terms.

					<h3>Truncation</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Truncation allows you to search different forms of the same word at the same time.</li>
						<li>Use the root of a word and add a symbol (such as an asterisk -*) as a substitute for the word’s ending.</li>
						<li>Psycho* --psychology, psychological, psychologist, psychosis, psychoanalyst</li>
						<li>Truncation can save time and increase your search to include related words.</li>
						<li>Now let’s take a look at these tools in action.</li>

					<h2>And what about Google Scholar?</h2>
					
					<img src="images/slide10_Google_Scholar.jpg" alt="Google Scholar site" class="feature"/>
					<p>
In the last module, we promised to show you how you can use Google for academic research. In our list of databases you’ll find Google Scholar, which is a subset of regular Google.</p>
					<p>It includes only journal articles, books, and reports from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, universities, and other web sites –exactly the kinds of scholarly sources your professors will often want from you.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p>While you won’t always find full text on Google Scholar (that’s one of its limitations), you canfind the citation of an article so you’ll have its title, author, journal title, date, and page numbers.</p>

					<h2>Finding the full text of an article when you have only a citation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>You can then take that citation information to the Library’s Journal Finder to see if one of our databases contains the journal you need.</li>
						<li>Having only a citation for an article isn’t a dead end. It contains all the information you’ll need to find the full text.</li>

					<span class="correct hide">Yes! This is the database that will be most useful as you search for relevant articles. In fact, this is a good place to start many searches for topics related to business and the economy.</span>
					<ul role="presentation">
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q3q1" data-c="false"/> A. Passport gmid – provides statistics and market reports for 205 countries around the world. The reports include historical trends and forecasts, analysis of key political and economic indicators, company profiles, and consumer market research. 
							<span class="error hide">Not the best choice. You could find information about the solar power industry in the u.s. And other countries, but this database does not provide access to articles in magazines, journals, and newspapers.</span>
						</li>
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q3q1" data-c="true"/> B. Business source complete – leading scholarly business database with over 1,300 publications, including peer-reviewed journals. Covers all business disciplines, including marketing, management, accounting, finance, and economics. Also includes financial data, company profiles, industry reports, market research reports, swot analyses, and more.

						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q3q2" data-c="true"/> <img src="images/body_objectification_article.jpg" alt="Title: Body Objectification, MTV, and Psychological Outcomes Among Female Adolescents"/>

							<span class="error hide">No, this isn’t the <em>best choice</em>. This one is a bit tricky, since the article does involve body image and adolescent girls, but it is concerned more with sociocultural factors than with the media, specifically. There is a better answer for this question.</span>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<label for="q3q3">You are searching for articles about college students and their jobs. What is the better search strategy?</label>
					<span class="correct hide">You’re right! This search connects two of the main concepts with the boolean operator “and,” so you’ll retrieve articles that deal with both students and work. Great job!</span>
					<ul role="presentation">
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q3q3" data-c="false"/> A. Students who work

						</li> 
					</ul>
					<label for="q3q3a">You are searching for articles about college students and their jobs. What is the better search strategy?</label>
					<span class="correct hide">Yes, this is right! You want your results to include one of these synonyms, so you’ve used the boolean operator “or” to search for articles that include at least one of the three terms.</span>
					<ul role="presentation">
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q3q3a" data-c="false"/> A. Work and employment and job

						</li> 
					</ul>
					<label for="q3q3b">You are searching for articles about college students and their jobs. What is the better search strategy?</label>

					<ul role="presentation">
						<li role="presentation">

						</li>
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q3q3b" data-c="false"/> B. College or students or work 
							<span class="error hide">Not right. You want your results to include all three terms. There might be some areas of overlap, but using “or” will retrieve all the articles that include any one or more of the three terms. Some of the retrieved articles will deal with work, for example, but will have nothing to do with college or students.</span>
						</li> 
					</ul>
					<label for="q3q4">Why are boolean search terms useful? Choose all that apply.</label>

						</li>
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q3q4" data-c="true"/> B. They can help expand search results  
							<span class="error hide">Exactly right. However, you must identify all three true statements to get full credit for this question.</span>
						</li> 
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q3q4" data-c="false"/> C. They can limit your search to the most recently published articles

						</li>
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q3q4" data-c="true"/> D. They can help exclude terms from a search 
							<span class="error hide">You’re right! You remembered how to use “not” to exclude topics that you don’t want in your results. However, you must identify all three true statements to get full credit for this question.</span>

					<label for="q3q5">You are researching education in china. In order to maximize your search results, you decide to use truncation to find terms such as education, educator, and other words with the same root. Which of the following would be the best truncated term to use for your search?</label>

				<p>Now that you know something about the types of information sources and where to find them, we need to talk about how to use them effectively.</p>
				<p>This module will teach you some skills for deciding whether a particular information source is right for your project.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Ask yourself about your information source</h2>
					<ol class="reveal">
						<li class="r1"><img src="images/m4r1.gif" class="info-icon" alt="C"/><strong><em>Is it CURRENT?</em> When was it published or posted? Does this date influence its usefulness?</strong></li>
						<li class="r2"><img src="images/m4r2.gif" class="info-icon" alt="R"/><strong><em>Is it RELEVANT?</em> Does it relate to your topic or answer your question? Is the language level appropriate (e.g., not too technical?)</strong></li>
						<li class="r3"><img src="images/m4r3-4.gif" class="info-icon" alt="A"/><strong><em>Is it AUTHORITATIVE?</em> Who is the author, publisher, or sponsor? What are the author's credentials?</strong></li>
						<li class="r4"><img src="images/m4r3-4.gif" class="info-icon" alt="A"/><strong><em>Is is ACCURATE?</em> Do the authors offer evidence to support claims they make? Has the information been peer-reviewed?</strong></li>
						<li class="r5"><img src="images/m4r5.gif" class="info-icon" alt="P"/><strong><em>What is its PURPOSE?</em> Does it information, sell, entertain, or persuade? Is it objective? Is it facts, opinion, or propoganda?</strong></li>
					</ol>

					<p>If your information source does not meet these criteria, it might be CRAAP! In that case, you may want to find another source.</p>

					<h2>Using format to evaluate a source</h2>
					<img src="images/slide3_contents.png" alt="article citation" class="feature"/>
					<p>Another way to evaluate a source is to look at its layout or format.</p>
					<p>Features such as tables of contents can help you determine quickly whether a source might be appropriate for your topic.</p>
					<p>The format of scholarly articles usually contains standard sections for describing research. Let’s take a deeper look.</p>

					<h2>Using format to evaluate a source (continued)</h2>
					<h3>Title page</h3>
					<img src="images/slide5_title_page.jpg" alt="title page" class="feature"/>
					<p>Some of the criteria you use to scan an article can also help you evaluate books. Let’s begin with the title and title page.
A book’s full title appears on the title page.</p>
					<h4>Full title</h4>
					<p><cite>The Great American Stickup: How Reagan Republicans and Clinton Democrats Enriched Wall Street While Mugging Main Street</cite></p>
				</article>
				<article>
				<h3>Verso page</h3>
				<img src="images/slide6_verso.jpg" alt="verso page" class="feature"/>
					<p>The back side of the title page is called the verso page. The verso page contains:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the copyright date, or publishing date</li>
						<li>the publisher name</li>
						<li>the location of the publisher</li>
					</ul>
				</article>
				<article>
				<h3>Table of contents</h3>
				<img src="images/mod4slide7gumballs.png" alt="contents" class="feature"/>
					<p>The table of contents at the front of the book will give you a good idea of what the book covers and how it is organized.</p>
					<p>Often the Introduction section will explain the contents in more detail and include historical background on the topic.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
				<h3>Index and bibliography</h3>
				<img src="images/mod4slide8gumballs.png" alt="index and biblio" class="feature"/>
					<p>At the back of the book, the index helps you find specific names or topics in the book that may not be listed in the table of contents.</p>
					<p>The bibliography contains references, or citations, to the sources of information that the authors used, so that readers can find the sources themselves.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Evaluating numeric and statistical data</h2>
					<img src="images/slide9_data_chart.jpg" alt="data chart" class="feature"/>
					<p>The publisher is the author, sponsor, or organization that is presenting the data will appear below the chart(s).</p>
					<p>The sponsoring organization may be different from who compiled the data.
The name of the publisher or sponsor can help you evaluate possible bias or conflict of interest.</p>

					<p>Using sources effectively includes using them ethically.</p>
					<p>This module will teach you about how to correctly credit the sources you use, and how to identify the main elements of citations from different sources.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Citing information sources</h2>
					<p>You’ll need to cite the sources you’ve used in your projects. Here’s an example of citations in the text of a paper.</p>
					<img src="images/slide2_intext_citation_no_arrows.gif" alt="cited paragraph" class="feature"/>
					<p><cite>Excerpt from: Comeaux, E., &amp; Harrison, C. (2007). Faculty and male student athletes: racial differences in the environmental predictors of academic achievement. Race, Ethnicity &amp; Education, 10(2), 199-214. doi:10.1080/13613320701330726</cite></p>
					<p>Ideas that are common knowledge do not have to be cited. For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Google is a popular search engine.</li>
						<li>The summer olympics are held every four years.</li>
						<li>Windows is one of the most common operating systems for personal computers.</li>
					</ul>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Why cite your sources?</h3>
					<img src="images/whycite_animated.gif" alt="cited paragraph highlighting reasons" class="feature"/>
					<ul class="reveal">
						<li>Lets others know where you found your information.</li>
						<li>Shows the validity/acceptability of your sources.</li>
						<li>Proves you’ve done the work required of your project.</li>
						<li>Gives credit to the author of an idea.</li>
						<li>Helps you use information ethically and legally.</li>
						<li>Helps you find your own sources later on when it’s time to create a bibliography.</li>
					</ul>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Quote or paraphrase?</h3>
					<h4>Quote</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When you use the exact words of someone else.</li>
						</ul>
					<h4>Paraphrase</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When you state someone else’s idea in your own words.</li>
						</ul>
					<p>Whether you quote or paraphrase, you must cite the source or else it is considered plagiarism.</p>

					“Finally, the records and statistics of any person testing positive for a banned substance should no longer be recognized as valid by the MLB. Assuming an athlete cares more about the mark he or she leaves on the sport than the money earned, nothing is more important than the statistical records one leaves behind. Imagine the deterrent effect on an athlete if abuse of performance-enhancing drugs led to the elimination of every statistic or record compiled by the player throughout a career. If nothing else, it would ensure that those who achieved greatness through hard work and perseverance are the ones that are recognized as great players.” <cite>(Tynes, 2006, p. 508)</cite>

					<span class="correct hide">Exactly right. We didn’t list all the reasons to cite your sources, but you have found two of the many ways in which in-text citations are useful.</span>
					<ul role="presentation">
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q5q1" data-c="true"/> A. To point the reader to the source’s full entry in the reference list

						</li>
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q5q1" data-c="false"/> B. To tell the reader who published the source   
							<span class="error hide">No. The in-text citation gives author, publication date, and sometimes a page number, but it doesn’t include publisher information.</span>
						</li> 
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q5q1" data-c="true"/> C. To briefly tell the reader where you got the information you are quoting or paraphrasing

					<label for="q5q2">For an assignment in your diversity in the workplace course, you read a book on sexual harassment and write down a quotation or two describing the results of the author’s survey, but you haven’t kept any information about the book. It’s the night before the assignment is due and the library is closed, so you cannot locate the book. You reorganize the words in the quotation and include them in your paper without citing them. This is:</label>
					<span class="correct hide">Exactly right! When you refer to the results of the author’s survey, you must credit the author even if you don’t include a direct quotation, since the ideas or research results are not yours.</span>
					<ul role="presentation">
						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q5q2" data-c="false"/> A. Fine, because you are not using a direct quote

						</li>
						<li role="presentation">

						</li>
						<li role="presentation">

						<li role="presentation">
							<input type="checkbox" name="q5q6" data-c="false"/> B. Since the year 2000, 16 states in the united states have enacted laws requiring voters to show picture identification at the time they vote (p. 451). Some people believe these laws will limit the number of people who will actually vote.
