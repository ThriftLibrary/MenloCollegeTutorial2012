					<h2>Bowman Library Research Skills Tutorial</h2>
					<p>The modules in this tutorial will put you on the right track when you research information for your projects.</p>
					<p>This tutorial consists of five modules. It is best to view the modules in the order they appear, but you do not have to do all of them at one time.</p>
					<p>For the most interactive experience, it is best viewed on a laptop or desktop computer using Chrome, Safari or Firefox browsers, but it can be viewed on mobile devices. </p>
					<p>Each module is followed by a quiz. There will be more details on that before you begin the quiz.</p>

<p>In this module, you'll be introduced to types of information sources, both popular and scholarly.</p>

<p>You'll also learn about the information process.</p>

<img src="images/slide2_girl.png" alt="girl studying" class="feature"/>

<h2>Research starts with a question</h2>

<p>For each project, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What do I want to know?</li>
	<li>What is the information I need to find to answer my question?</li>
</ul>
				</article>
				<article>

<p>Some of your projects at Menlo might include:</p>
<ol class="reveal">
	<li class="r1"><img class="info-icon" src="images/m1r1.gif" alt="market research graphic"/><strong>Doing market research on a product or company</strong></li>
	<li class="r2"><img class="info-icon" src="images/m1r2.gif" alt="psychology assignment graphic"/><strong>Finding scholarly articles for a psychology assignment</strong></li>
	<li class="r3"><img class="info-icon" src="images/m1r3.gif" alt="ancient civilization paper graphic"/><strong>Writing a paper about an ancient civilization</strong></li>
	<li class="r4"><img class="info-icon" src="images/m1r4.gif" alt="issue debate graphic"/><strong>Researching a controversial issue for a debate</strong></li>

<h2>Types of information sources</h2>

<img src="images/slide7_apples_oranges.png" alt="apple and orange" class="feature"/>

<p>In order to determine which sources are the most authoritative and will best meet your needs for a particular  project, you have to understand something about the types of information sources that exist.</p>
	<img src="images/mod1slide7gumballs.png" alt="data, periodicals, books" class="gumballs"/>
<ul>
	<li>Some sources you'll use to answer research questions might be:
	<ul>
		<li>data and statistics</li>
		<li>magazine, newspaper, and journal articles</li>
		<li>books</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You'll use information sources in print and online formats.</li>
	<li>You'll use both popular and scholarly sources, depending on the project
	
	<ul>
		<li>Popular sources are written for a general audience. Scholarly sources are written for an academic audience. You'll hear about these sources in more detail later.</li>
		<li>Each type of information source is the product of a process involving varying amounts of research, writing, and  review.</li>
		<li>Let's take a closer look, beginning with data and statistics.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/mod1slide8gumballs.png" alt="party and scholar" class="gumballs2"/>
				</article>
				<article>

<h3>Data and statistics</h3>
	<img src="images/mod1slide9gumballs.png" alt="DNA and chart" class="gumballs2"/>
<ul>
	<li>Data interpretation and analysis lead to the creation of information and knowledge.</li>
	<li>Data collection can take minutes (such as weather data) or years (such as census data)</li>
	<li>Data are multidisciplinary; the same set of data can be used by researchers in many different fields.</li>
	<li>Data can be in either numeric or non-numeric form. For example, statistics about traffic patterns are numeric data,  while videos of runners at the finish line of a race are non-numeric data.</li>
	<li>Knowing how to find and make use of data will be a valuable skill long after you graduate.</li>
</ul>

				<div class="article-image">
					<img src="images/slide12_popular_sources.jpg" alt="popular magazines"/>
				</div>
<h3>Popular sources</h3>
<p>Here, the word "popular" is used to describe something that is intended for use by the general public.</p>
<p>Popular information sources:</p>
<ul>
	<li>May be online, in print, or both.</li>
	<li>Include some books, as well as magazines, newspapers, blogs, web sites, product catalogs and reviews, and company  annual reports.</li>
	<li>Are published on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis and can take anywhere from a day (newspapers) to months (in- depth magazine articles) to produce.</li>
	<li>Are written by paid journalists or authors who may not have scholarly expertise.</li>
	<li>May report on the original research of others, information from scholarly sources, current events, and include data  or facts about events.</li>
	<li>Often do not include bibliographies or lists of sources.</li>
	<li>May be reviewed by editors or may be self-published.</li>
	<li>Are selected by librarians for the Library's collection based on subjects that students and faculty research here  at Menlo.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scholarly/academic sources</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scholarly sources are also often called academic, peer-reviewed, or refereed sources.</li>
<li>Scholarly sources can take months or years to produce and publish because of the research and review process that  goes into creating them.</li>
<li>Let's take a look at this research and review process.</li>
</ul>
				</article>
				<article>
<h3>The scholarly research and review process</h3>
<ol  class="reveal">
	<li class="r1"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>Researchers conduct research or experiments, then write about their findings.</strong></li>
	<li class="r2"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>Researchers submit the article to a peer-reviewed journal or, if it's a book, to an academic press or publisher.</strong></li>
	<li class="r3"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>The article or book is reviewed by other experts (the researchers' peers) in the same field as the researcher.</strong></li>
	<li class="r4"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>Peer-reviewers may suggest or require changes, or they may reject the work entirely.</strong></li>
	<li class="r5"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>Researchers make changes based on the reviewers' comments.</strong></li>
	<li class="r1"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>The article or book is published by the journal or publisher in print and digital formats.</strong></li>
	<li class="r2"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="more arrow"/><strong>Librarians review, select, and subscribe to books, print journals, and online databases containing these scholarly  works to support courses and research at Menlo.

<ul>
	<li>You're familiar with Wikipedia, but it is not an academic source.</li>
	<li>Entries in Wikipedia are created by many contributors, many of whom are not experts.</li>
	<li>Information in Wikipedia is sometimes inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
	<li>But before disregarding Wikipedia, consider how it can be useful:
		<ul>
			<li>Offers an overview of an unfamiliar topic</li>
			<li>Provides useful keywords or search terms</li>
			<li>Might include a bibliography with sources that you can use to find more information</li>

<h3>Overview of the information process</h3>
<p>Although the various types of information sources are different in several ways, they also have something in common:  
the use of data. Data are the building blocks of information and include much more than numbers. Data are facts,  events, and items of information presented in visible form.</p>
<img src="images/slide23_data_pop_schol.png" alt="data flower" class="feature"/>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Popular sources:</strong>
Researchers and writers of popular sources such as news articles, blogs, and books often include data, facts, and  details of events in their work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scholarly sources:</strong>
Just as data form the basis for popular information sources, data play an even larger role in scholarly work.  Scholarly information sources include things like journal articles, 
scholarly books, data sets, dissertations,  textbooks, and reference works.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scholarly &amp; popular sources:</strong>
We've talked about the research process from data to published work.
But where do YOU fit in?
</li>
</ul>
				</article>
				<article>

<h4>Where YOU fit into the process:</h4>
<img src="images/slide24_data_plus_you.png" alt="data with student" class="feature"/>
<ul>
	<li>Understanding the differences between information types will help you decide which sources to use for your  projects.</li>
	<li>This knowledge will also help you decide where to search.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recap of what you've learned</h3>
<p>Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Recognize the central role of data in the information process</li>
	<li>Identify characteristics of popular and scholarly information sources</li>
	<li>Understand the scholarly research and review process</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <a href="#module2">next module</a>, we'll discuss the process of searching for information.</p>

				<h2>Getting ready to search</h2>
				<p>In Module 1 you learned about types of information sources; now it’s time to start using some of them.</p>
				<p>
In this module, you’ll learn how to search library resources effectively.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Designing your search</h2>
				<h3>How to begin a successful search</h3>
				<ol class="reveal">
					<li class="r1"><img src="images/m2r1.gif"  class="info-icon" alt="students reading"/>
					<strong>Carefully read your assignment and be sure you understand it</strong></li>
					<li class="r2"><img src="images/m2r2.gif" class="info-icon" alt="highligting terms"/>
					<strong>Identify the key words or concepts</strong></li>
					<li class="r3"><img src="images/m2r3.gif" class="info-icon" alt="whiteboard"/>
					<strong>Find synonyms for the main terms</strong></li>
					<li class="r4"><img src="images/arrow.gif" class="info-icon" alt="arrow icon"/>
					<strong>Document your search by keeping a list of all search terms</strong></li>
				</ol>
				<!--image-->
			</article>
			<article>
			<h2>It’s your turn to design a search</h2>
			<p>In a class or in the work world, you may have a project like the one listed below. Review it carefully and discuss it with your professor or your boss and your client, if appropriate, to ensure you have a successful project.</p>
			<p>
Project:You work in the marketing field. You have a client who is investigating launching a new green product and is interested in the characteristics of consumers who use such products. Select terms you might use for each search category.</p>
<!--exercise-->
<p>Remember that there may be other good search terms that we haven’t listed here.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
			<h2>Brainstorm a concept map</h2>
			<img src="images/slide4_concept map.jpg" alt="concept map whiteboard" class="feature"/>
			<ul>
				<li>Sometimes a visual or concept map can also help you brainstorm search terms.</li>
				<li>Additionally, it might help you develop an outline for your project.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here’s a sample concept map for the following psychology project:</p>
			<h3>
			Examine the psychological causes and effects of bullying among adolescents.
			</h3>
			<p>Once you’ve considered the search terms you’ll use, you’re ready to try them out in a search. But where will you start?</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Web Searching</h2>
				<h3>Your first stop might be Google, and you might have some success there, but remember…</h3>
				<img src="images/slide6_web_search2.png" alt="Web search funnel" class="feature"/>
				
				<h3>You’ll get millions of results to sort through, many of which will not be helpful.</h3>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Going beyond Google</h2>
				
				<p>Google sometimes <em>is</em> the fastest, easiest way to the information you need –think about movie listings or sports scores –but it might not meet your needs for academic projects.</p>
				<img src="images/mod2slide7gumballs.png" alt="easy doesn't equal scholarly" class="gumballs"/>
				<ul>
					<li>There <em>are</em> ways you can use Google successfully in your academic work, such as Google Scholar, and we’ll discuss that in the next module.</li>
					<li>But if not Google, where <em>should</em> you start your search?</li>
				</ul>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>Using library resources</h3>
				<p>The place to start your search is the Library’s web site. You’ll find thousands of online and print resources that have been selected by the Menlo librarians to support your classes and assignments.</p>
				<img src="images/mod2slide8gumballs.png" alt="library web resources" class="gumballs"/>
<p>You won’t find most of our resources on Google or the Web because our subscriptions are available only to the Menlo community.</p>
			<p>When you need books and e-books, you can find them in our catalog; when you need articles, you can find them in our databases.</p>
			<p>And when you need to know if the Library subscribes to a particular magazine, journal, or newspaper, you can use the Journal Finder to search by title. It will tell you if the publication is available on our shelves or in our databases.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>So, what <em>is</em> a database?</h3>
				<img src="images/mod2slide10gumballs.png" alt="databases for information" class="gumballs"/>
				<ul>
					<li>You’ll hear the word “database” a lot when using library resources, so let’s be sure you know what they are.</li>
					<li>Databases are searchable collections of information. You already use them when you search for songs in iTunes, for friends in Facebook, and for books in Amazon.</li>
					<li>Most databases rely on similar methods of searching, so while the databases themselves may look different, once you have mastered one, it’s much easier to learn how to search others.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Library catalog</h3>
				<img src="images/slide9_Library_materials.jpg" alt="library materials search" class="feature"/>
				<p><strong>The Library catalog is one
database you’ll be using.</strong> It’s
the place to find print books,
e-books, dvds, cds, print
magazines, and print journals.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You won’t find individual articles here, however. You’ll have to search one of the Library’s subscription databases for those.</li>
				<li>Let’s take a look at how to search the Bowman Library catalog.</li>
			</ul>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>Searching the catalog</h3>
				<!--video-->
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Recap of what you've learned</h2>
				<p>Now that you’ve completed this module, you should be able to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Design a search based on the requirements of your project</li>
					<li>Identify relevant search terms</li>
					<li>Understand the function of databases</li>
					<li>Use the library catalog</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In the <a href="#module3">next module</a>, we’ll continue to focus on searching and look at the Library’s article databases.</p>

				</div>
					<h2>Continuing to search</h2>
					<p>In the previous module on searching, we discussed using the library catalog when you need books.</p>
<p>In this module, we’ll talk about the times when you’ll need articles from periodicals (magazines, journals, newspapers). That’s when you’ll want to turn to the Library’s databases.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Library databases (what)</h2>
					<p>What you'll find in the library databases:</p>
					<ol class="reveal">
						<li class="r1"><img src="images/m3r1.gif" class="info-icon" alt="magazines"/><strong>Journal, magazine, and newspaper articles, both current and past</strong></li>
						<li class="r2"><img src="images/m3r2.gif" class="info-icon" alt="encyclopedia articles"/><strong>Articles from encyclopedias and other reference works, both scholarly and popular</strong></li>
						<li class="r3"><img src="images/m3r3.gif" class="info-icon" alt="country database"/><strong>Country demographics</strong></li>
						<li class="r4"><img src="images/m3r4.gif" class="info-icon" alt="company database"/><strong>Company reports</strong></li>
						<li class="r5"><img src="images/m3r5.gif" class="info-icon" alt="financial pages"/><strong>Financial/stock data</strong></li>
					</ol>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Library databases (where)</h2>
					<img src="images/mod3slide3gumballs.png" alt="databases screenshots" class="gumballs"/>
					<p>On the Library’s web site you’ll find an alphabetical list of all our databases, as well as lists of databases by subject.</p>
					<p>We also have lists of the databases most useful for specific classes. Look for the links to Course Research Pages and Subject Research Guides on the Library’s home page.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Library databases (when)</h2>
					<img src="images/slide4_Menlo_ID.jpg" alt="Menlo College ID barcode" class="feature"/>
					<p>If you’re not sure where to begin your search, you can always ask a librarian, in person or by phone. We’re here every hour that the Library is open and we’re here to help! You can access the library databases 24/7 with your library barcode.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>It's your turn to choose databases</h3>
					<img src="images/slide5_woman_and_doors.jpg" alt="woman choosing from doors" class="feature"/>
					<p>Individual library databases might focus on only one subject, such as psychology or business, or might contain articles from many disciplines. Using the description of the databases listed below, match each with the kind of information you might expect to find there.</p>
					<!--exercise-->
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Advanced search techniques</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Scholarly databases like the ones the Library subscribes to are more complicated to use than search engines like Google and Yahoo because they offer sophisticated tools and techniques for searching that can improve your results.</li>
						<li>Many databases, including the library catalog, offer tools to help you narrow or expand your search. Take advantage of these.</li>
						<li>The most common tools are:
						<ul>
							<li>Boolean searching</li>
							<li>Truncation</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						
					</ul>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Boolean searching</h3>
					<p>Boolean searching uses AND, OR, and NOT when combining your search terms.
Click on each pair of circles in the diagrams below to learn more.</p>
<blockquote>When you combine search terms with AND, you’ll get results in which BOTH terms are present. Using AND limits the number of results because all search terms must appear in your results.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When you use OR, you’ll get results with EITHER search term. Using OR increases the number of results because either search term can appear in your results. Note that there could be some results in which both terms appear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
When you use NOT, you’ll get results that exclude a search term. Using NOT limits the number of results.</blockquote>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Truncation</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Truncation allows you to search different forms of the same word at the same time.</li>
						<li>Use the root of a word and add a symbol (such as an asterisk -*) as a substitute for the word’s ending.</li>
						<li>Psycho* --psychology, psychological, psychologist, psychosis, psychoanalyst</li>
						<li>Truncation can save time and increase your search to include related words.</li>
						<li>Now let’s take a look at these tools in action.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>And what about Google Scholar?</h2>
					
					<img src="images/slide10_Google_Scholar.jpg" alt="Google Scholar site" class="feature"/>
					<p>
In the last module, we promised to show you how you can use Google for academic research. In our list of databases you’ll find Google Scholar, which is a subset of regular Google.</p>
					<p>It includes only journal articles, books, and reports from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, universities, and other web sites –exactly the kinds of scholarly sources your professors will often want from you.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p>While you won’t always find full text on Google Scholar (that’s one of its limitations), you canfind the citation of an article so you’ll have its title, author, journal title, date, and page numbers.</p>
					<img src="images/slide11_Google_Scholar_results.jpg" alt="Google Scholar results page" class="feature"/>
					<img src="images/slide11_CyberPsychology.jpg" alt="article citation" class="feature"/>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Finding the full text of an article when you have only a citation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>You can then take that citation information to the Library’s Journal Finder to see if one of our databases contains the journal you need.</li>
						<li>Having only a citation for an article isn’t a dead end. It contains all the information you’ll need to find the full text.</li>
						<li>Let us show you some ways to get the article you want.</li>
					</ul>

				<p>Now that you know something about the types of information sources and where to find them, we need to talk about how to use them effectively.</p>
				<p>This module will teach you some skills for deciding whether a particular information source is right for your project.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Ask yourself about your information source</h2>
					<ol class="reveal">
						<li class="r1"><img src="images/m4r1.gif" class="info-icon" alt="C"/><strong>Is it CURRENT?</strong> When was it published or posted? Does this date influence its usefulness?</li>
						<li class="r2"><img src="images/m4r2.gif" class="info-icon" alt="R"/><strong>Is it RELEVANT?</strong>Does it relate to your topic or answer your question? Is the language level appropriate (e.g., not too technical?)</li>
						<li class="r3"><img src="images/m4r3-4.gif" class="info-icon" alt="A"/><strong>Is it AUTHORITATIVE?</strong> Who is the author, publisher, or sponsor? What are the author's credentials?</li>
						<li class="r4"><img src="images/m4r3-4.gif" class="info-icon" alt="A"/><strong>Is is ACCURATE?</strong> Do the authors offer evidence to support claims they make? Has the information been peer-reviewed?</li>
						<li class="r5"><img src="images/m4r5.gif" class="info-icon" alt="P"/><strong>What is its PURPOSE?</strong> Does it information, sell, entertain, or persuade? Is it objective? Is it facts, opinion, or propoganda?</li>
					</ol>
					<p><cite>CRAAP acronym &amp; concept credit: CSU Chico, Meriam Library</cite></p>
					<p>If your information source does not meet these criteria, it might be CRAAP! In that case, you may want to find another source.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Using format to evaluate a source</h2>
					<img src="images/slide3_contents.png" alt="article citation" class="feature"/>
					<p>Another way to evaluate a source is to look at its layout or format.</p>
					<p>Features such as tables of contents can help you determine quickly whether a source might be appropriate for your topic.</p>
					<p>The format of scholarly articles usually contains standard sections for describing research. Let’s take a deeper look.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Parts of a Journal Article</h3>
					<!--video here-->
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Using format to evaluate a source (continued)</h2>
					<h3>Title page</h3>
					<img src="images/slide5_title_page.jpg" alt="title page" class="feature"/>
					<p>Some of the criteria you use to scan an article can also help you evaluate books. Let’s begin with the title and title page.
A book’s full title appears on the title page.</p>
					<h4>Full title</h4>
					<p><cite>The Great American Stickup: How Reagan Republicans and Clinton Democrats Enriched Wall Street While Mugging Main StreetUsing</cite></p>
				</article>
				<article>
				<h3>Verso page</h3>
				<img src="images/slide6_verso.jpg" alt="verso page" class="feature"/>
					<p>The back side of the title page is called the verso page. The verso page contains:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the copyright date, or publishing date</li>
						<li>the publisher name</li>
						<li>the location of the publisher</li>
					</ul>
				</article>
				<article>
				<h3>Table of contents</h3>
				<img src="images/mod4slide7gumballs.png" alt="contents" class="gumballs2"/>
					<p>The table of contents at the front of the book will give you a good idea of what the book covers and how it is organized.</p>
					<p>Often the Introduction section will explain the contents in more detail and include historical background on the topic.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
				<h3>Index and bibliography</h3>
				<img src="images/mod4slide8gumballs.png" alt="index and biblio" class="gumballs2"/>
					<p>At the back of the book, the index helps you find specific names or topics in the book that may not be listed in the table of contents.</p>
					<p>The bibliography contains references, or citations, to the sources of information that the authors used, so that readers can find the sources themselves.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Evaluating numeric and statistical data</h2>
					<img src="images/slide9_data_chart.jpg" alt="data chart" class="feature"/>
					<p>The publisher is the author, sponsor, or organization that is presenting the data will appear below the chart(s).</p>
					<p>The sponsoring organization may be different from who compiled the data.
The name of the publisher or sponsor can help you evaluate possible bias or conflict of interest.</p>

					<h2>Evaluation steps</h2>
					<h3>Before you read</h3>
					<p>No matter what information source you use…</p>
					<ol class="reveal">
						<li class="r1"><img src="images/m4ar1.gif" class="info-icon" alt="looking"/><strong>Before reading, look at the section headings of an article, chapter, or website. Notice how it’s organized. <em>This will help your understanding of the content.</em></strong></li>
						<li class="r2"><img src="images/m4ar2.gif" class="info-icon" alt="formula"/><strong>Make sure you understand the language level of the source. <em>An article using language that is too technical may not help you, even if it is about your topic.</em></strong></li>
					</ol>
					<h3>As you read</h3>
					<ol class="reveal">
						<li class="r3"><img src="images/m4ar3.gif" class="info-icon" alt="writing"/><strong>Write down the ideas, facts, and statistics that are important to your topic or argument.<em>Keep track of the page numbers or section where you found your information.</em></strong></li>
						<li class="r4"><img src="images/m4ar4.gif" class="info-icon" alt="watch"/><strong>Write down as much citation information as possible. <em>Writing things like the author’s name, the title, the date, and exact web address will save you time and trouble later.</em></strong></li>
					</ol>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Take your research to the next level.</h3>
					<ol class="reveal">
						<li class="r1"><img src="images/m4br1.gif" class="info-icon" alt="books"/><strong>Use a variety of sources.</strong></li>

					<p>Using sources effectively includes using them ethically.</p>
					<p>This module will teach you about how to correctly credit the sources you use, and how to identify the main elements of citations from different sources.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h2>Citing information sources</h2>
					<p>You’ll need to cite the sources you’ve used in your projects. Here’s an example of citations in the text of a paper.</p>
					<img src="images/slide2_intext_citation_no_arrows.gif" alt="cited paragraph" class="gumballs2"/>
					<p><cite>Excerpt from: Comeaux, E., &amp; Harrison, C. (2007). Faculty and male student athletes: racial differences in the environmental predictors of academic achievement. Race, Ethnicity &amp; Education, 10(2), 199-214. doi:10.1080/13613320701330726</cite></p>
					<p>Ideas that are common knowledge do not have to be cited. For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Google is a popular search engine.</li>
						<li>The summer olympics are held every four years.</li>
						<li>Windows is one of the most common operating systems for personal computers.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Why cite your sources?</h3>
					<ul class="reveal">
						<li>Lets others know where you found your information.</li>
						<li>Shows the validity/acceptability of your sources.</li>
						<li>Proves you’ve done the work required of your project.</li>
						<li>Gives credit to the author of an idea.</li>
						<li>Helps you use information ethically and legally.</li>
						<li>Helps you find your own sources later on when it’s time to create a bibliography.</li>
					</ul>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Quote or paraphrase?</h3>
					<h4>Quote</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When you use the exact words of someone else.</li>
						</ul>
					<h4>Paraphrase</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When you state someone else’s idea in your own words.</li>
						</ul>
					<p>Whether you quote or paraphrase, you must cite the source or else it is considered plagiarism.</p>
					<h3>Try it! Read the article segment below.</h3>
					<blockquote>
					“Finally, the records and statistics of any person testing positive for a banned substance should no longer be recognized as valid by the MLB. Assuming an athlete cares more about the mark he or she leaves on the sport than the money earned, nothing is more important than the statistical records one leaves behind. Imagine the deterrent effect on an athlete if abuse of performance-enhancing drugs led to the elimination of every statistic or record compiled by the player throughout a career. If nothing else, it would ensure that those who achieved greatness through hard work and perseverance are the ones that are recognized as great players.” <cite>(Tynes, 2006, p. 508)</cite>
					</blockquote>
					<h4>Quoting</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Tynes argues persuasively that "the records and statistics of any person testing positive for a banned substance should no longer be recognized as valid by the MLB" <cite>(2006, p. 508).</cite></li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Paraphrasing</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>The author argues that major league baseball players who are caught using steroids should be stripped of their statistical legacy -- their career records and achievements <cite>(Tynes, 2006)</cite>.</li>
					</ul>
